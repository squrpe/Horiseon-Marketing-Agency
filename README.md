# Horiseon Marketing Agency
---

## Description

This project was built on the idea that this website would be viewed by the customers of a marketing agency. Thus, the webpage must meet accessibility standards. The starter code was sourced [elsewhere](#credits) and this project then refined the HTML and CSS code for long-term sustainability. This project solved a variety of semantic HTML issues, unnecessary uses of css selectors as well as add necessary accessibility features such as alternative text for images. This project allows one to learn the proper use of semantic html elements, the importance of accessibility standards, and overall increase the efficiency and durability of an existing codebase.

## Usage

To access this project, you can download an IDE of your choice but we recommend Visual Studio Code.

After downloading the IDE of your choice you will have access to the raw code. However to host the webpage locally, you will need to download an extension that allows you to open it into your default browser or in your IDE. I recommend Liveserver:

Then using this type of extension, right clicking the file and pressing "Open with Live Server" allows you to open the webpage in your default browser.
